# Benchflux Datasets Repository

This repository serves as a shared space for the Benchflux research group. Each team is encouraged to maintain a subdirectory containing their dataset and a simple tutorial notebook for data exploration. A shared Google Cloud Storage bucket (gs://benchflux-team-data) is available for uploading tarballs of your dataset or a representative subset. Each subdirectory should include clear instructions for accessing the data and basic code for familiarization.

This repository is currently set as private pending further discussion by the group. Either way, be sure that any shared data is appropriate for internal use, and include any relevant notes on licensing, usage restrictions, or provenance.
